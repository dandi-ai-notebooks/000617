Step 1 in the plan is to get the Dandiset metadata. According to the instructions, I need to run `python tools_cli.py dandiset-info 000617 --version 0.250312.0130`. 
This command will provide information such as the Dandiset's name, description, and other metadata needed for notebook context and overview.

    "description": "Adaptive and coordinated behavior requires that an animal be able to make predictions about the near and even far future. This intuition that some neural computations should be \u2018predictive\u2019 in their character has a long history, starting with ideas about how the receptive field structure of retinal ganglion cells relate to the statistics of natural visual scenes. Ideas about predictive computation have been most influential in thinking about the function of the neocortex. Here, the relatively stereotyped local circuitry of the neocortex has long led to speculation that each local circuit might be carrying out a somewhat similar, fundamental computation on its specific inputs. In addition, the organization of sensory-motor pathways into hierarchies (e.g., V1, V2, V4, IT in the ventral visual stream) with stereotyped feedforward and feedback connections has motivated ideas about hierarchical predictive codes, where higher levels of the hierarchy send predictions down to the lower level that then compares its inputs against the predictions and only send the surprises up the hierarchy (such as in the work of Mumford, Rao & Ballard, and Friston). Despite the wide influence of ideas about predictive coding, there is relatively little experimental evidence that such computations occur in multiple cortical areas, perhaps serving as a \u2018canonical computation\u2019 of the neocortical microcircuit. Our experimental design is based on a Sequence Learning Experiment, in which head-fixed mice passively view sequences of three different natural movie clips (labeled \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019), each having a duration of 2 seconds. We begin with one recording session (day #0), where the movie clips are presented in random order along with a 2 second grey screen (labeled \u2018X\u2019). Each stimulus occurs a total of 525 times, allowing a thorough characterization of neural responses before any sequence learning has occurred. Next, there are 3 recording sessions where the three movie clips are presented in a repeating temporal sequence, ABCABC\u2026, for 500 times, in order to train the mouse\u2019s brain. This training allows the mouse to potentially use the identity of the current movie clip predict the next movie clip. In addition, each sequence training session includes a period of random-order presentation, in order to assess changes in neural tuning during sequence learning. Finally, our last session (day #4) had stimuli presented in random order, allowing us to test more thoroughly how responses changed due to sequence learning.\n\nOur design uses 2-photon microscopy with eight simultaneously recorded fields-of-view. The fields-of-view will include both layer 2/3 and layer 4 as well as from multiple cortical areas: V1 (VISp), LM (VISl), AM (VISam), and PM (VISpm). The experiment used the Cux2-CreERTS2:Camk2a-tTa; Ai93(TITL-GCaMP6f) mouse line, which has expression in excitatory neurons of both layer 4 and 2/3.",

Step 2 is to get the Dandiset assets so I can see what files (including NWB files) are available for exploration and analysis. Once I have the list and details for the files, I will pick one NWB file, extract its asset ID, and then get information about that file in step 3. For now, I’ll run the command:
python tools_cli.py dandiset-assets 000617 --version 0.250312.0130
This will provide a listing of all assets and their asset IDs.

Step 3 is to pick one NWB file from the assets above, then get info about it with `python tools_cli.py nwb-file-info 000617 <NWB_FILE_URL> --version 0.250312.0130`.

I'll pick the asset:
- path: sub-677038/sub-677038_ses-1280089433-acq-1280384858_ophys.nwb
- asset_id: 27dd7936-b3e7-45af-aca0-dc98b5954d19

The URL is: https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/27dd7936-b3e7-45af-aca0-dc98b5954d19/download/

I'll run:
python tools_cli.py nwb-file-info 000617 https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/27dd7936-b3e7-45af-aca0-dc98b5954d19/download/ --version 0.250312.0130
to get streaming usage and detailed info for this NWB.

I now have all needed information: Dandiset metadata, assets list, and detailed structure and access pattern for a representative NWB file (https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/27dd7936-b3e7-45af-aca0-dc98b5954d19/download/). 

I will create `notebook.py` using Jupytext format. It will include:

- A title and clear note re: AI-generated content.
- Dandiset overview (with a link), purpose, and summary of coverage.
- Required package list (with code).
- Code to load Dandiset/metadata using DANDI APIClient.
- Code and markdown to load/explore the chosen NWB, with structure summaries, code to display relevant metadata, tables, and initial visualizations.
  - Show how to load basic voltage/acquisition traces, stimulus templates, imaging ROI traces, and the segmentation table.
  - Show how to display parts of the table, e.g., first few entries, and visualize traces or images.
  - Link to the NWB file on neurosift.
- Appropriate markdown guidance and explanations for each cell.
- Concluding markdown cell for summary/future directions.

Now I will write the full contents to `notebook.py`.

This intuition that some neural computations should be ‘predictive’ in their character has driven both experiment and theory. Here, a Sequence Learning Experiment was conducted using head-fixed mice viewing repeated sequences of natural movies, leveraging two-photon microscopy to record neural activity across layers and cortical areas (see DANDI for the full description).\n#\n# **Citation:**  \n# Berry, Michael; Lecoq, Jérôme; Amaya, Avalon; ...

# ## Dandiset Overview
#
# - **Title:** Allen Institute Openscope - Sequence Learning Project
# - **Dandiset ID:** 000617
# - **Version:** 0.250312.0130
# - **Link:** [View on DANDI Archive](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000617/0.250312.0130)
# - **Keywords:** L2/3, L4, two-photon calcium imaging, prediction, pyramidal neurons, somata, neocortex, predictive coding, predictive processing, sequence learning, movies
#
# **Description:**  
# Adaptive and coordinated behavior requires that an animal be able to make predictions about the near and even far future. This intuition that some neural computations should be ‘predictive’ in their character has driven both experiment and theory. Here, a Sequence Learning Experiment was conducted using head-fixed mice viewing repeated sequences of natural movies, leveraging two-photon microscopy to record neural activity across layers and cortical areas (see DANDI for the full description).

# ## What this notebook covers
#
# This notebook guides you through exploration and analysis of Dandiset 000617.  
# It demonstrates how to:
#
# - Connect to DANDI using the DANDI API
# - List and inspect Dandiset assets
# - Load and summarize an NWB file from the Dandiset
# - Visualize various data streams (e.g., voltage, fluorescence, stimulus presentations)
# - View segmentation and ROI tables
# - Link out to external tools for further exploration
# 
# > The main purpose is to show HOW to access and work with the data. Visualization and commentary are primarily illustrative and should not be interpreted as analysis or results.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Required packages
#
# The following Python packages are required (assume they are already installed in your environment):
#
# - dandi
# - pynwb
# - remfile
# - h5py
# - numpy
# - pandas
# - matplotlib
# - seaborn

# %%
# Import needed packages (do not include installation commands)
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.set_theme()
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [10, 4]

# %% [markdown]
# ## Connect to the DANDI Archive and Explore the Dandiset
#
# We'll start by connecting to the DANDI Archive using the DANDI APIClient. Then, we'll print basic information about the Dandiset and list a few of the assets.

# %%
from itertools import islice
from dandi.dandiapi import DandiAPIClient

dandiset_id = "000617"
dandiset_version = "0.250312.0130"

client = DandiAPIClient()
dandiset = client.get_dandiset(dandiset_id, dandiset_version)

# Print metadata
metadata = dandiset.get_raw_metadata()
print(f"Dandiset name: {metadata['name']}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choosing an NWB File to Explore
#
# For illustration, we'll focus on a single NWB file from the Dandiset:
#
# ```
# sub-677038/sub-677038_ses-1280089433-acq-1280384858_ophys.nwb
# ```
#
# - **Asset ID:** 27dd7936-b3e7-45af-aca0-dc98b5954d19
# - **URL:** https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/27dd7936-b3e7-45af-aca0-dc98b5954d19/download/
#
# > We now show how to load this NWB file using PyNWB and remfile, following recommended best practices for remote access.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Load the NWB file and show basic metadata
#
# We'll use `remfile.File` and `h5py.File` to stream the NWB directly from the archive.
# (The cell below may take some seconds depending on the file size and your connection.)
#
# **Note**: We won't display the raw nwb object as output to avoid excessive output.

# ## Further Analyses and Next Steps
#
# This notebook has shown how to:
#
# - Connect to and explore a DANDI NWB dataset
# - Summarize and access acquisition, stimulus, segmentation, and ROI data
# - Display selected traces, images, masks, and tables
#
# **Potential next steps for deeper analysis might include:**
# - Correlating calcium activity with stimulus blocks or running speed
# - Investigating differences across ROIs, or exploring particular stimulus sequences/trials
# - Clustering or sorting activity across the population during movies
# - Adapting code to batch process other NWB files from this Dandiset
